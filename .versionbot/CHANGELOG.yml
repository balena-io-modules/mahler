    - subject: Change '*' to 'update' as default task operation
      hash: 8bd9f3a49f6c5289529d07555c38ee30984118f1
      body: |
        After creating the applicability table between tasks and state
        operations, it became clear that these two values had the same effect,
        so '*' was removed for simplicity

    - subject: Calculate the target before planning
      hash: 95167c187444815866dd199ca11b741e1e5a7e54
      body: |
        The target state was being calculated at each planning state, allowing
        effects to leech into next iterations of the plan via the target.

        This now calculates the target state only at the beginning, when the
        current state comes from the actual system state. While this is still
        not perfect, as the target may end up containing stuff that we really
        might not want in the final state (think a container re-start, where
        we don't care about the final containerId), the target at least is
        calculated from real data

    - subject: Split service tasks into install and start
      hash: 3891cf7f209d5743b015cb78558b6324839aafc8
      body: |
        This allows to handle more granular scenarios, for instance, that the
        service stopped on error and we want it to be restarted.
