      hash: 80cc80867ba124954ae5756f4dfe14d38820c2ab
      body: |
        This splits up the `planner.ts` module into multiple files under
        `lib/planner`, it also renames some methods, properties for better
        readability.

        The function was leftover from before improving the [diff

        The function is no longer needed.

      body: |
        Tasks declared for a `delete` operation no longer receive a `target`
        property, since it does not make sense with the way delete operation
        works. This also makes it simpler to call delete tasks as less data
        needs to be passed to the grounding function.

      hash: 627cb8f11c54acbb2ec0356549a6ba3beb5fd3f2
      body: |
        This creates some utility tasks to perform some common operations in
        the state of the system.

        - A `NoOp` task can be used for debugging under some conditions
        - A `Pure` task is a task that only performs transforms on the local
          state without affecting the system (e.g. a cleanup)
        - A `Constructor` task is used for initializing an element of the state

      hash: 3682d3c6e39f4c9b97fd287565ca609803af12fb
      body: |
        A change in a deep property of a state object implies
        some operations on the object hierarchy, for instance a `delete` of a
        key `/a/b/c/d`, implies an `update` operation on `/`, `/a`, `/a/b` and
        `/a/b/c/d`, this means that any task defined for one of these paths is
        applicable to the operation.

        This change updates the `Diff` implementation so it generates all
        possible combination of changes

      body: |
        Task.of now returns the proper type (MethodTask or ActionTask) depending
        on the input. This makes it easier to use these types as part of
        testing. However, this comes with the tradeoff that tasks need to at
        least defined an `effect` property or a `method` property to be type
        checked correctly.

      body: >
        Creating a new instance with `Diff.of` will now return a function to

        calculate pending operations. This removes the public `patch` function as that

        is not used by the planner and that is replaced by a readonly property

        returning the result of patching a source object with the provided target.

      hash: c96373e2ddcc06ac40aa3256f682667beab1bde0
      body: |
        This moves the runtime behavior of the agent to a `Runtime` class, now
        under `lib/agent/runtime.ts`, making the code easier to read. The agent
        interface definition is now under `lib/agent/index.ts`

        This also modifies the behavior of the agent from polling to being
        influenced by sensors. Configuring an agent with `follow` true, means
        that new state changes coming from sensors will trigger re-plans to
        check if the state has gone off-target.

        This removes path and target from `Instance` interface in `task.ts` in

        removing the need for the `json.ts` utils module

      body: |
        The target state was being calculated at each planning state, allowing
        effects to leech into next iterations of the plan via the target.

        This now calculates the target state only at the beginning, when the
        current state comes from the actual system state. While this is still
        not perfect, as the target may end up containing stuff that we really
        might not want in the final state (think a container re-start, where
        we don't care about the final containerId), the target at least is
        calculated from real data
